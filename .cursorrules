# Football Edu Game - Cursor Rules

## Project Overview
This is an educational football game web application for children aged 7-8 years old. The game combines educational questions with football gameplay mechanics.

## Design Document
**ALWAYS refer to and follow the game design document located at: `Game Design/gameDesign.txt`**

All game mechanics, rules, UI/UX requirements, and architecture decisions should align with the design document. Before making any significant changes, review the design document first.

## Technology Stack

### Backend
- **Language**: Python 3.8+
- **Framework**: Flask or FastAPI (lightweight web framework)
- **Database**: SQLite (using Python sqlite3 module)
- **API**: RESTful API endpoints

### Frontend
- **Framework**: Vue.js 3.x
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Styling**: CSS3 with mobile-responsive design
- **State Management**: Vuex or Pinia (if needed)

### Data Storage
- **Questions**: SQLite database
- **Configuration**: JSON/YAML configuration files
- **Translations**: JSON files for i18n

## Key Requirements

### Game Mechanics
- 5v5 mini soccer format (4 outfield + 1 goalkeeper per team)
- Actions: Pass, Dribble, Shoot, Tackle
- Each action triggers educational multiple-choice questions
- Success probabilities are configurable via `game_config.json`
- Defense must be cleared before shooting (configurable number of actions)
- Opponent AI randomly selects actions
- All percentages/configurable values must be loaded from configuration files

### Internationalization
- Support 3 languages: English (en), Greek (el), German (de)
- All UI text and questions must support multilingual display
- Translations stored in `translations.json` or similar structure
- Language selection via UI option

### UI/UX
- Clean and simple design for kids aged 7-8
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Large touch targets (minimum 44x44px)
- Kid-friendly colors and animations
- Clear visual feedback for all actions

### Configuration
- All game probabilities/configurable in `game_config.json`
- Language translations in separate translation files
- Configuration should be editable without code changes
- Support for multiple difficulty levels/presets

## Code Style Guidelines

### Python
- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Write clear, readable code with comments
- Use parameterized queries for database operations (prevent SQL injection)

### JavaScript/Vue
- Use Vue 3 Composition API when appropriate
- Follow Vue.js style guide
- Use ESLint for code quality
- Keep components small and focused
- Use meaningful variable and function names

### General
- Write self-documenting code
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions focused on single responsibility
- Use consistent naming conventions across the project

## File Structure
Follow the architecture outlined in the design document:
- Backend: models/, routes/, services/, database/, config/
- Frontend: components/, views/, services/, store/, utils/
- Configuration files in config/ directory
- Design documents in Game Design/ directory

## Important Notes
- Always validate user inputs on the backend
- Prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks
- Ensure mobile responsiveness for all UI components
- Test on multiple browsers and devices
- Keep performance in mind (lightweight rendering, efficient state management)
- Questions should be age-appropriate (7-8 years old)
- Support multiple question pools with management features

## Testing Considerations
- Test all game actions and probability calculations
- Verify question system works correctly
- Test language switching functionality
- Verify mobile responsiveness
- Test configuration loading and application
