I want to create a football game for my son. The football game needs to be a web app that also renders nicely on a mobile screen. I want the user interface to be very clean and simple as the target audience is kids 7-8 years old. The goal of the game is to get the kids to do homework related activities by wrapping it up around the football game concept that they like. The main idea is the following. The players will have teams of 5 players, with 5 opponents (like in mini soccer), 4 outfield players and one goalkeeper. Players will be able to do a pass, dribble or shoot. Each of the actions when selected should trigger an educational question. the questions will be multiple choice from a pool of questions (need multiple pools of questions so we need a feature for that). If the players answer correctly they should have a % chance to complete the action. Pass: 80%, Dribble 60%, Shot on target 50%. When a shot is on target, the opponent goalkeeper has a 50% chance to block the shot. when a dribble or pass fails. the opponent team should get the ball. opponents should randomly select an option (pass,dribble, shot). when the opponent does pass or dribble the player should have a chance to tackle and gain the ball. to do a tackle he needs to answer a question again. if the question is done correctly the tackle should succeed with 75% change. if the tackle fails then in case of a pass, the ball goes to the next opponent, if the tackle fails in case of a dribble, there is a foul. players and computer opponent can only shoot after they have cleared the defense. defense can be cleared by a series of passes and dribbles. I want all these percentages to be configurable via a configuration file (so that i can adjust difficulty layer). I will provide 2d assets for players, ball and football pitch once we have the design ready. Based on the above requirements. Write me a game design. Make sure you write down the rules/flow of the game but also technical requirements. I want the game to use simple tech stack (e.g. python for backend, with a python implementation of sqlite and some nice lightweight javascript for the front (for example Vue)). The game instructions/user interface should be provided in 3 languages. Greek Engilish and German. The language instructions should be in a configurable file for me to be able to switch via an option. 1) Write this prompt in a file called prompts.txt 2) Write the game design in a file called gameDesign.txt Put both of these files in a folder called Game Design 3) Initialize a cursor rules file to instruct the agentic composer to always stick to the design - include in there the tech stack and link to the gameDesign.txt

ok leave the preview as it is. Lets now design the actual game play. Here is what i need. The ball starts with the midfield player on the blue team (pick randomly one of the two). the midfield player has two options as he is currently blocked a) pass and b) dribble. The midfield player needs to be on the passing pose nad have the ball. the rest of the players need to be on the waiting stance or defending stance (at random) for both teams. If he passes successfully, then the ball goes to the attacker of his team or his other midfielder (50% chance for each). if the ball is passed to another player, change that player that received the pass to the passing stance and the player that gave the ball switches to the defensive stance. if he dribbles, then he swaps position with his opponent in front of him and switches to the dribbling stance. he can then either dribble again (past the last defender) or pass to his attacker team mate. if pass or dribble fails based on the defined percentages, the ball needs to be taken by the opposing team. the opponent that won the ball switches to passing or dribbling stance and everyone else in defending or waiting. Implement this game sequence and add buttons on the ui for dribble/pass/shoot (shooting should be greyed out unless only the goalkeeper is left). Implement proper state management in the game to achieve this and connect the game state with the graphics as described by the rules and this prompt. Before you start copy this prompt to prompts.txt
